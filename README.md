# Unposts
WordPress Plugin for disabling posting capabilities.  Useful for when the blog
feature WordPress offers is not necessary for the site and you would like the
Post, Comments options to disapear.  The idea is to remove functionality from Wordpress so a site's backend makes more sense for the site's purpose.

## Things Unposts disables:
 - From the admin menu, both Posts and Comments.
 - From the admin bar that appears at the top of the site when logged in, the New Post option.
